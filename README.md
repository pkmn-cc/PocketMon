**PocketMon** (named in reference to the [original Pokemon
manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_Monsters_(manga)), with ‘Pocket’ emphasizing its
superior mobile experience) [is](https://pkmn.cc/vaporware.png) a next-generation Pokémon battling
client UI and tools suite optimized for high-level competitive play on the modern web. PocketMon
builds on top of [EPOké](https://github.com/pkmn/EPOke)'s enhanced battle state tracking and
prediction engine to provide the best battle experience to competitive players on both desktop and
mobile. The PocketMon UI offers built-in cooperative damage calculator, team-builder, analyses, and
usage statistics functionality and ultimately aims to support fully offline play against a version
of the [0 ERROR](https://github.com/pkmn/0-ERROR) battling AI.
